An age calculator with a little more precision. (Made with Python.)

Again this is an older project from when I was teaching myself Python. One of the exercises asked for an age calculator. I didn't like the outputs that the course example generated so I made one which I felt was more usable.

## Features

* Works based on a DATEDIFF function. Logic is performed on the output.
* Basic misinput handling.
